`bdg_to_bw.py -f input.list` see: https://hemtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/Bioinformatics_tools/bdg_to_bw.html

## Workflow

Read `Editable_A_scores.combined.scores.csv` file, which was generated in the `comparison to CADD DeepSEA and GERP` step, convert it to bdg file, then convert it to bw file.
