Average signals were extracted from rmdup.bw (PE data) or all.bw (SE data). Command is from HemTools: https://hemtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/Machine_learning/bw_over_bed.html

## Data format

Pos and Neg defnitions were the same as HbF score classification.

`pos.bed` is HbF score >= 50

`neg.bed` is HbF score == 0

Average signals were the outputs from `bw_over_bed.py`.
