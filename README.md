# Summary

This is a functional score characterization framework for base editor gRNA screening. In our 6194 gRNAs (which are selected based on human-mouse conservation and known GWAS studies), we have totally 13147 candidate Adenines (i.e., from 1 to 20). Based on our amplicon sequencing, we found positions from 1 to 13 have >1% editing frequency. Therefore, our HbF functional scores were defined for Adenines from position 1 to 13, resulting in 10156 Adenines.

Our scores were compared to well-known disease-associated scores (i.e. CADD), chromatin-regulatory scores (i.e., DeepSEA), and conservation scores (i.e., GERP).


# Get Started

This is a repository to provide source code and data used in the paper:  Assessment of the Functional Effects of regulatory sequences at Base-Pair-Resolutioni through In Vivo High-Throughput Base Editing  

Each folder is a component that corresponds to a figure/table or an analysis. See below:


Also, go to each folder to see a detailed README to run the code in that part.
